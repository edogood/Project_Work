This repository contains a Python project that implements an EpisodeManager class, which manages episodes, handles backup operations, and processes configurations using JSON and INI files.

The project is structured to include the following key components:

EpisodeManager Class: A class that manages episodes by creating and reading a JSON file.
IniManager Class: A class that manages the configuration file.
Backup File (Bak): A backup of the server data, typically stored as a .bak file.
Project.py: The main executable script that ties everything together by executing the classes and operations.
config.ini: A configuration file used for setting up parameters, such as connection strings and paths.
